what is the problem?
We need to write a program that will receive a user input which is stores.
After that we need to generate a computer-generated input.
Compare both and see who has won after playing a few games.

input --> user-input + computer generated input
output --> game that will tell who has won.
gameplan:

1. get user input via a prompt for rock, paper, or sciccors. The casing does not matter (f.e. RoCk should also be possible!).
2. generate computerinput for one of the three options (function)
   Do this by getting a random number from 0 to 2 which will tell us which of the three different option to choose for computerGuess.

3. we get two inputs, so we need to check them which of the two will win based on all of the different conditions.
   --> rock paper, paper wins
   --> rock scissors, rock wins
   --> sciccors paper, scissors win.
4. write a function that plays one round and decided the winner.
5. create a game function that loops 5 times the round function, i.e. play 5 rounds + keep the score to determine whose the winner at the end.
6. OPTIONAL: create a game function that will play x amount of times, depending on the amount of games that the player wants to play.

7. OPTIONAL: write a function that asks the player whether he wants to play another game or not.
